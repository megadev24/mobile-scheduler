# Initial Submission

Hi! This was certainly a fun project

There were a few things I wanted to address

# Intentions
## Creativity
  - I wanted to attack this project with something I have been working with in IndexedDB to give me a realistic approach to working with a DB/APIs
  - This may have been a slight mistake, as it ate up more time than I would have liked, but it made the experience pretty interesting at the same time
  - I really tried to stay away from existing views, so they wouldn't plague my thoughts with how something should look. 
  - I wanted to create something that looked somewhat refreshing to all of the reviewers

## Intial Screen
  -  I struggled with this a little. The instructions said we had an id to work with, but it felt like in a reasonable setup we'd have some sort of role to go off of too, so I added that in and made a developer-ish view to allow for changing between diffrent users with different roles to test the condditional renddering and other facets of roles and functionality.

## Code Cleanlieness
  - While I think there are certainly areas that are a little code heavy, I think the intention is in the code.
  - With more time, I likely would have wrappped the DB up in context and moved a lot of the date functionality into utility hooks so I wasnt having to copy and paste, research, re-format, re-find
    all of the date related stuff

## Styling: 
  - I'm pleased with most of my work pre-rush-towards-the-deadline-in-a-mad-rush

## My biggest qualm:
  - No matter what I tried to do, I couldnt get the "Soonest Available" time for a provider to account for the availability being reserved within the schedule. I did, however, try to catch the scenario where I user would overlap a reservation

## Testing:
  - I initially thought I might get to testing and adding unit tests. Ha....

## Overall:
  - I'm interested to get feedback. I went with a very free form slot methodolgy for making reservations, and probably would have had a much easier time sectioning out each our in 4 blocks of 15 min pieces. I learned a ton about my skill level and areas for improvement that I have. I wanted to get this into a much more production ready state but was probably much closer to MVP-ish

### Notes:
  - I added the ability to delete the db and refresh the view with what the default data was so I could test different levels of the DB with little amounts of data to some.
  - There is slight theming in there thanks to MUI and it's ease of use and setup

#### Thanks!
